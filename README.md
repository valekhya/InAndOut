# InAndOut

This is my first C# project. It is a very basic project where I learned MVC pattern, CRUD operations, Actions, etc., in .NET. 

The project contains a tab named "My borrowed items". On that tab, add, modify or delete.
It is an in-progress application. Further features/implementations can be seen in the future.

Thank you,
